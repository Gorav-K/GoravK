               I am currently in my third-year studying Computer Science at John Abbott College, in Montreal, Canada. <br></br>
               <br></br>
               I explored many things before I became fascinated with computer science! I began by studying engineer at John Abbott College before changing track to study Science. Once I discovered the keys, my passion for computer science grew. <br></br>
               <br></br>
               I have excelled in game programming, database and web development, where I got to utilize my creativity and problem-solving skills while working on various academic projects. I am comfortable working as part of a team or independently. I am confident that my ambition, commitment and ongoing determination to learn more about the field are assets I can bring to the table.
